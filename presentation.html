<h2>Alice, Bob, and Carol</h2>
<p>Alice works for a small company, and her boss just asked her to get a bunch of data from AliceBane.com.  She&apos;s becoming overwhelmed at the amount of data and how many times she's going to have to click to get all the data they need.</p>
<p>Bob works for a slightly larger company that makes a web application that keeps breaking.  He has been assigned to figure out how to test the site and keep it reliable, and is starting to feel bored going through the same steps over and over to test each iteration of the application.</p>
<p>Carol is friends with both Alice and Bob, and is about to help both of them out, but she doesn&apos;t know that yet.</p>

<section class="slide" id="meeting">
<h2>The Meeting</h2>
<p>Alice, Bob, and Carol go to lunch together one day, and Alice starts talking about her problem first.  Bob pipes up, and they go back and forth for a bit about how repetitive their tasks are and how long they&apos;ll take, until Carol manages to find a break in the conversation and says, "Have you considered Selenium?"</p>
<p>"What&apos;s Selenium?" they both replied in unison.</p>
<p>"Selenium is a tool for automating manual browser tasks.  You can use it from most popular programming languages, and it provides an API that you can use to automate your repetitive tasks, getting the information you need, Alice, and checking that the parts of your application are working properly, Bob."</p>

Story:
- Introduce Alice and Bob
  - Alice needs to get data from a site, but they don't provide an API
  - Bob needs to test a web application
- Enter Selenium!
  - Bob uses Selenium to test the web application Firefox, Chrome, and IE
  - Alice uses Selenium to drive a PhantomJS browser instance to get her data
- Uh, oh, something changed!
  - The web developers changed the css selectors Bob used in his tests!
  - Now he needs to go through and change the selectors everywhere
- DRY review
- Enter page maps
  - Bob uses a key-value data type to store the selectors he needs, separating the way their code accesses the page from the way the page is constructed
  - Now he only need to update the page map structure when something changes
  - He tells Alice, and she starts doing the same thing to address a similar issue
- Something bigger changed!
  - Alice needs more data, but the steps to get the data have changed
- Enter page objects
  - Alice creates a class for each unique page and puts the page maps in them
  - Alice adds object methods corresponding to specific tasks to be done
  - Now if something changes again, she only needs to update the page object
- Alice and Bob get involved in the community
  - IRC
  - Github/Google Code
  - Mailing list
- Finding more information
  - Official project documentation
  - Twitter
  - Blogs
  - Language binding documentation
  - StackOverflow
